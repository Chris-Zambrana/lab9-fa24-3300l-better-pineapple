Our project is essentially a combination between Lab 7 and Lab 8 where the vending machine will play a sound whenever there is user input. Therefore, if a user inputs 0 through 7, Q, D, or S on the keyboard, then sound will play out of the FPGA. In terms of elements we used within this project, we used all of the modules within Lab 7 and most in Lab 8. For the most part, we pretty much included all the modules within both labs, but we made changes to the rx_parse and read_music modules. The rxparse module within our project includes two more outputs, dout and note_start. Note_start always starts off low every clock cycle and is set high whenever rx_dv goes high, so the note_start goes high for one clock cycle. Additionally, the data in rx_byte goes into dout also when rx_dv goes high, but obviously this data transfer has to occur before the note_start goes high. The readmusic module in our project just changes the note cases to include 0 through 7, Q, D, and S in ASCII and each case has their own distinct frequency. The last changes we made were we removed the rams_sp_wf and button_pulse module entirely because we donâ€™t need to use buttons or a memory bank for this project.
